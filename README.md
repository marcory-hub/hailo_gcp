Raspberry Pi 5 with AI-kit Hailo8L accelerator experiments: Google Cloud Platform Setup

## [Create Google Cloud Platform VM Instance and Connect via SSH](https://github.com/marcory-hub/hailo/blob/main/create-and-connect-gcp-vm-instance-w-local-terminal.md)

Initial setup of a virtual environment for Hailo8L accelerator experiments. It involves creating a Virtual Machine (VM) instance on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and establishing a secure SSH connection to it. Once connected, you can interact with the VM as if it were a local machine. This provides a foundation for installing the Hailo Software Suite in the subsequent part.
